# Fruitbar
Here are the QMK files for the fruitbar keyboard orignally run by: [Fruit](https://github.com/blewis308)
I have created these files to make the encoder work as the orignal one didn't, and I have added code to have an animated bongo cat
on the OLED screen. These files are also updated to the latest QMK MSYS at the time it was made. 

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make fruitbar:default

See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information. Brand new to QMK? Start with our [Complete Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).
